# Searching

Searching is arguable one of the most common operations to traverse and identify a target value among data structures. So here, we'll have a look
at some of them where the operation is performed on some common data structure like arrays, trees, and graphs

The package comes with another class and interface:
- The [Displayer](./Displayer.java) class helps generalize the array flow of comparing two numbers. Whereas the first one exists within the array, and the second one doesn't (default to MAX_INT)
- The [Searchable](./Searchable.java) interface creates common ground between multiple searching algorithm, grouping them for the above class
